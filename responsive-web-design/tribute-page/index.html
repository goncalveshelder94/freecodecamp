          <p>Sitting on the sofa, her shoes kicked off, putting the final touches to that letter It couldn't be more different from the very formal portrait of Theresa May signing the Article 50 letter in Downing Street. Very different images - and that is no
            accident. But while the picture may look quite casual, the contents of this letter are not. In it the first minister asserts that she has a clear mandate to ask for another referendum since the Scottish parliament voted to back her on Tuesday. And
            she repeats her request for a vote in 18-24 months time. She says by then the shape of the Brexit deal will be clear. But she knows what the prime minister is going to say in reply. Constitutional matters are reserved to Westminster so the Scottish
            government must ask for the powers to hold such a vote to be transferred to Holyrood under a Section 30 order, as was done before the 2014 referendum. The Scottish government released a photo of Nicola Sturgeon drafting the letter to Theresa May,
            with her feet curled up on a sofa at her official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh. The letter is expected to be sent to Downing Street on Friday. Ms Sturgeon is seeking a referendum between the autumn next year and spring 2019 - but has indicated
            she would be willing to negotiate the timing. If, as expected, the request is declined, Ms Sturgeon has said she will set out her government's next steps in April, when MSPs return to the Scottish Parliament after the Easter recess. Image copyright

            resumed on Tuesday, the minority SNP government was backed by the pro-independence Scottish Greens in the vote, with the Conservatives, Labour and Lib Dems opposed. Scottish voters rejected independence by 55% to 45% in a referendum in 2014, but
            Ms Sturgeon believes the UK voting to leave the EU is a material change in circumstances which means people should again be asked the question. While the UK as a whole voted to leave, Scotland voted by 62% to 38% to remain in the EU.
